# D-Project2-PT-Renewable-Energy-Dashboard

This project was completed in collaboration with **PowerTrust**, focusing on developing a Tableau dashboard to visualize renewable energy generation and Distributed Renewable Energy Certificates (D-RECs) across multiple countries.  
The dashboard helps PowerTrust identify high-performing projects, track emission reductions, and make data-driven sustainability decisions.

* **Dataset:** PowerTrust Renewable Energy Dataset (12,432 entries across 13 countries).  
* **Tool:** Tableau  
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, calculated fields, geographic filtering, and interactive dashboard design.  
* **Key Objectives:**  
  - Visualize renewable project performance by country and developer.  
  - Track CO‚ÇÇ reduction and D-REC generation.  
  - Identify outliers, anomalies, and operational improvement areas.

### üìä Dashboard Highlights

**Global Dashboard**
- Interactive map visualizing project distribution and energy generation.  
- Summary cards displaying total energy, CO‚ÇÇ reduction, and D-RECs.  
- Filters for country, developer, and site type for dynamic exploration.  

**Country-Level Dashboards**
- **India:** 558 projects, 8.2B g/kWh CO‚ÇÇ reduced, 13,281 D-RECs.  
- **Ghana:** 3 projects with 8.1B g/kWh CO‚ÇÇ reduced and 13,077 D-RECs.  
- **Vietnam:** Steady performance with strong emission reductions across projects.  

**Calculations**
- *CO‚ÇÇ Reduction:* `799 √ó Energy Generated (kWh)`  
- *D-RECs:* `Energy Generated / 1000`

### üå± Key Findings
- India and Vietnam show strong renewable generation capacity.  
- Ghana, despite few projects, delivers unusually high energy output ‚Äî requires validation.  
- Some projects have mismatched SMR start/end dates, corrected through calculated fields.  
- Underperforming countries (e.g., Libya, Algeria) indicate opportunities for expansion.

### üîç Recommendations
- Review data anomalies by consulting developers.  
- Integrate private APIs (e.g., DHI, DNI, GHI) for more precise solar metrics.  
- Incorporate SDG metrics (via SDG Action Manager) to track local sustainability impact.
